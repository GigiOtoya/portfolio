  "about": [
    "My journey into programming began with a fascination for tinkering with computers, leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My love for art initially drew me into the front-end space where I could blend visual creativity with coding. As I delved deeper, I discovered the intricacies of backend engineering, eventually broadening my skills to encompass diverse aspects of software development.",

    "I've worked on some exciting projects, including a game driven ASL learning app, a Pathfinding Visualizer for exploring complex algorithms, and a Squad Builder platform for soccer enthusiasts. Alongside coding, my interest in 3D animation led me to use Blender, creating animations and writing Python add-ons for the platform. When not coding, I enjoy playing soccer, animating, and experimenting with new tech ideas."
