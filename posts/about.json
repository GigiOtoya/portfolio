  "about": "Hi, I'm Luigi Otoya! I recently graduated from The City College of New York with a degree in Computer Science. I love diving into full stack development, especially working with technologies like Node.js, React, Spring Boot, and Docker. I've worked on some cool projects like an ASL learning app, a Pathfinding Visualizer, and a Squad Builder for soccer fans. Iâ€™m also into 3D animation with Blender and even write Python add-ons for it. In my free time, you'll probably find me playing soccer or tinkering with new tech.",
